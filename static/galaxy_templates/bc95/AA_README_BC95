BRUZUAL-CHARLOT ATLAS is a library of galaxy spectra computed by Bruzual 
and Charlot using their Isochrone Synthesis Spectral Evolutionary Code.
The December 1995 version of the Bruzual-Charlot atlas consists of 21
instantaneous bursts characterized by different IMF slope functions, and
mass limits. Each instantaneous burst contains 221 spectral energy 
distributions (SEDs) corresponding to 221 time steps from 0 to 20 Gyr.<p>

To get to the original and complete Bruzual & Charlot library, i.e. set of
binary data files and decoding programs, go to BRUZUAL-CHARLOT ATLAS. 
To learn all details about the content of this library and how to generate
specific spectral templates, read first the postcript version of the README
file you will find in the directory.<p>

The on-line library of SEDs consists of 84 STSDAS binary files. All SEDs have
been obtained using the original binary bc95*.ised files and the program
galaxevpl as explained in the readme file of the Bruzual-Charlot library. <p>

The on-line SEDs represent bursts characterized by a Salpeter initial mass
function (IMF) with different ranges in lower and upper mass limits, and at
several ages (10E5, 25E5, 50E5, 76E5, 10E6, 25E6, 50E6, 10E7, 50E7, 10E8, 50E8,
10E9 years) after the burst. SEDs for instantaneous and composite bursts are
available. Each SED has 1187 wavelength points covering the 100 angstroms to 100
microns wavelength range, and the fluxes are given in units of solar luminosity per Angstrom. The nebular contribution to the spectral energy distribution, 
i.e. emission lines and nebular continuum, is not include in the SEDs. <p> 

A list of the on-line SEDs, and corresponding file names, is given in the 
table below. In the file name, the "XXXX" indicate the age of the burst. For
example, the file bc95_d_50E5.tab contains the SED for a five million years old
instantaneous burst characterized by a Salpeter IMF with lower and upper mass
limits of 2.5 and 125 solar masses. Should ASCII files be preferred, please
use the "tdump" task within the ttools package of IRAF to convert the
STSDAS binary table format into an ASCII file. <p>
